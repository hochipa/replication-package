# replication-package
project about identifying characteristics in tv shows using r-studio to make a script
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

For my project I analyzed the date and rating of each episode, as well as whether the episode was action packed or related to the plot. I used IMDb to determing date and rating, and measured action packed and plot related subjectively. We collected 151 observations, and used 30 episodes for each show that we analyzed, but if the 30th episode ended in the middle of the season, we finished watching the rest of the season. 

Date was measured in years. The earliest date that we observed was 2008, and the latest was 2023. The average date was 2016 with a standard deviation of 5.28. 

Rating was measured out of 10. The lowest rating  was 7.3 and the highest was 9.7. the average rating throughout all of the episodes was an 8.42 with a standard deviation of .54. 

Action packed and plot related were measured binarily, where 0 meant no, not action packed or plot related, and 1 meant yes, it was action packed, and plot related. However, this is measured subjectively, and may vary from person to person. 60 percent of episodes were action packed, and 73 percent of episodes were important to the plot.
