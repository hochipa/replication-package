project about identifying characteristics in tv shows using r-studio to make a script

Paragraph 1: Explain what data you used for the analyses, how you gathered your data, and any other relevant information. In this paragraph, you should make clear the unit of analysis, how many observations were collected, and what type of sampling strategy you used. Paste your professional descriptive table here with the title “table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Variables Used in the Analysis”. The table should include all variables that you will analyze.

Paragraph 2 through X: Explain how you operationalized each concept, specifying the measurement scale or coding system used. Also, justify any choices made in deciding how to measure the concept. For each variable, you should directly interpret all relevant summary statistics from table 1. Include 1 separate paragraph for each variable

For my project I analyzed the date and rating of each episode, as well as whether the episode was action packed or related to the plot. I used IMDb to determing date and rating, and measured action packed and plot related subjectively. We collected 151 observations, and used 30 episodes for each show, but if the episode ended in the middle of the season, we continued to watch the episodes until the end of the season. 

Table 1: Descriptive Statistics	for variables used in the analysis			
	 Mean	   SD	   Min     Max	    Description
Rating	 8.42	   0.54	   7.3	   9.7	    the popularity and likeability of a tv show episode measured on imdb.com
Date	   2016	   5.28	   2008	   2023	    when the tv show episode was released found on imdb.com
Action	 0.6		         0	     1	      was there action in the episode, 1 for yes, 0 for no
Plot	   0.73		         0	     1	      was the episode important to the plot, 1 for yes, 0 for no
n = 151					

Date was measured in years. The earliest date that we observed was 2008, and the latest was 2023. The average date was 2016 with a standard deviation of 5.28. 
Rating was measured out of 10. The lowest rating  was 7.3 and the highest was 9.7. the average rating throughout all of the episodes was an 8.42 with a standard deviation of .54. 
Action packed and plot related were measured binarily, where 0 meant no, not action packed or plot related, and 1 meant yes, it was action packed, and plot related. This is measured subjectively, and may vary from person to person. 60 percent of episodes were action packed, and 73 percent of episodes were important to the plot.
